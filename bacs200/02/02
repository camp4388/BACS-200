            What makes a hero?  A hero is someone that we look up to.
            Heroes embody what we truly value most.  Therefore who we select as
            role models says a lot about who we are as people.
        </p>
        <p>
            The heroes that I most admire have the following characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Outrageously courageous - they disturb the status quo and define a new normal</li>
            <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
            <li>Face adversity</li>
            <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
            <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Aaron Rodgers is my inspiration. I am a big Packers fan and I have watched him play my entire life and I think he has a great story. He was a small kid from chico California and did not receive a division one offer out of high school. He then went to Cal after going to a community college and played great. In the NFL draft he was supposed to be drafted number 1 overall but fell in the draft to Green Bay. Aaron Rodgers was doubted his entire life and then he came into the NFL and became one of the greatest QBs of all time.
